# n8n-QuantBot

üß† **Project Name**: n8n-QuantBot
üéØ **Objective**: To build a modular, fully automated algorithmic trading bot using n8n that fetches stock data and news, prepares & analyzes the data, predicts future stock prices, assesses news sentiment, combines insights for a trading decision, sends a summary to the user, executes trades via broker API (conceptual), and monitors stock prices for sell decisions.

## Architecture Overview

The bot is designed as a series of interconnected agents (n8n nodes) that form a trading pipeline:

1.  **Cron Trigger / Webhook (Start)**: Initiates the workflow.
2.  **Data Fetch Agent**: Fetches stock price data.
3.  **Data Clean Agent**: Preprocesses raw data using a Python script.
4.  **Forecasting Agent**: Predicts price movement using a Python ML model.
5.  **News Fetch Agent**: Fetches relevant company news.
6.  **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Performs NLP on news using a Python script.
7.  **Strategy Combiner Agent**: Merges forecast and sentiment for a decision.
8.  **Notification Agent**: Sends a summary to Slack/WhatsApp.
9.  **Manual Approval Agent (Optional)**: Waits for user confirmation before trading.
10. **Trade Execution Agent**: Places orders via broker API (conceptual).
11. **Sell Signal Monitoring Agent (Separate Workflow)**: Monitors for sell conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   n8n instance (can be run via the provided `docker-compose.yml`)
*   API Keys for:
    *   Stock data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)
    *   News API provider (e.g., NewsAPI)
    *   Broker API (e.g., Zerodha, Upstox) - for actual trading
    *   Slack Webhook URL (for Slack notifications)
    *   Twilio or similar for WhatsApp (Account SID, Auth Token, From Number)
*   Python environment with necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, ML/NLP libraries like `statsmodels`, `pmdarima`, `prophet`, `vaderSentiment`, `textblob`) if you intend to run and develop the Python scripts locally or build custom Docker images for n8n's Execute Command node.

### Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository (or create files locally based on this structure)**:
    ```bash
    # If this were a git repo:
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd n8n-quantbot
    ```
    For now, ensure you have the directory structure and files as listed above.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `n8n-quantbot/` root directory.
    *   Add your API keys and other configurations. Example:
        ```env
        # n8n Environment
        GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York
        TZ=America/New_York

        # API Keys
        STOCK_API_KEY=your_stock_api_key
        NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
        ZERODHA_API_KEY=your_zerodha_api_key # Conceptual
        ZERODHA_SECRET=your_zerodha_secret   # Conceptual

        # Notification Services
        SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
        TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886 # Example Twilio sandbox number
        USER_PHONE_NUMBER=+12345678900 # Your WhatsApp number for receiving messages

        # Add any other necessary environment variables for your Python scripts or n8n nodes
        ```

3.  **Run n8n via Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    cd n8n-quantbot
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start an n8n instance accessible at `http://localhost:5678`.

4.  **Import the Workflow**:
    *   Open your n8n instance in a web browser.
    *   Go to "Workflows" and click "Import from File".
    *   Upload the `n8n-quantbot/workflows/trading_pipeline.json` file.

5.  **Configure n8n Nodes**:
    *   Open the imported "n8n-QuantBot Trading Pipeline" workflow.
    *   **API Keys & URLs**: Many nodes (HTTP Request, Slack, etc.) are configured to use environment variables (e.g., `{{$env.STOCK_API_KEY}}`). Ensure these are correctly set in your `.env` file and picked up by Docker Compose.
    *   **Execute Command Nodes**:
        *   These nodes are placeholders to run the Python scripts (`data_cleaner.py`, `price_forecast.py`, `sentiment_model.py`).
        *   **Important**: For the `Execute Command` nodes to run Python scripts, n8n needs access to a Python environment with the necessary libraries.
            *   You can achieve this by building a custom Docker image for n8n that includes Python and your libraries, then referencing that image in `docker-compose.yml`.
            *   Alternatively, for simpler cases, if the n8n base image has Python, you might be able to install libraries into the running container's `~/.n8n/custom` directory or mount a volume with a pre-prepared virtual environment. The provided `docker-compose.yml` includes commented-out volume mounts for `models` and `utils` which could be a starting point if your n8n image can execute Python scripts directly from mounted paths.
        *   Update the commands in these nodes if your script paths or execution methods differ.

## Component Details

### 1. Workflows
*   **`workflows/trading_pipeline.json`**: The main n8n workflow.
    *   See the JSON file for node details and connections.
    *   This workflow orchestrates the entire process from data fetching to (conceptual) trade execution.
*   **`workflows/sell_signal_monitoring_conceptual.md`**:
    *   A conceptual outline for a separate workflow to monitor owned stocks and generate sell signals. This is not an executable workflow but a design document.
*   **`workflows/notification_flow_conceptual.md`**:
    *   Details on setting up Slack and WhatsApp notifications within n8n.

### 2. Python Scripts
*   **`utils/data_cleaner.py`**:
    *   Placeholder script to clean raw stock data.
    *   Input: Raw JSON data from stock API.
    *   Output: Cleaned JSON data.
    *   *Needs customization based on your chosen stock API's data format.*
*   **`models/price_forecast.py`**:
    *   Placeholder script for price forecasting.
    *   Input: Cleaned JSON data.
    *   Output: Forecasted prices.
    *   *Requires a trained ML model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) and logic to load/run it.*
*   **`models/sentiment_model.py`**:
    *   Placeholder script for news sentiment analysis.
    *   Input: JSON data containing news articles.
    *   Output: Sentiment score(s).
    *   *Requires an NLP model/library (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, HuggingFace Transformers).*
*   **`utils/broker_api_conceptual.md`**:
    *   A design document for interacting with broker APIs. This is not runnable code but provides a structural guideline for building out trade execution capabilities.

### 3. Configuration
*   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the n8n service, port mappings, and environment variable passthrough.
*   **`.env`**: Stores all your sensitive API keys and configurations. **Do not commit this file if it contains real secrets.** Use `.env.example` as a template if sharing the project.

## Next Steps & Customization
1.  **Flesh out Python Scripts**:
    *   Implement actual data cleaning logic in `data_cleaner.py` specific to your data source.
    *   Develop/integrate your price forecasting model in `price_forecast.py`.
    *   Develop/integrate your sentiment analysis model in `sentiment_model.py`.
2.  **Broker API Integration**:
    *   Based on `broker_api_conceptual.md`, develop Python scripts to interact with your chosen broker's API.
    *   Securely manage authentication (this is often the most complex part).
3.  **Refine n8n Workflow**:
    *   Update HTTP Request nodes with actual API endpoints.
    *   Adjust parameters and logic in all nodes to fit your strategy.
    *   Implement robust error handling within the workflow.
4.  **Build Custom Docker Image for n8n (Recommended for Python)**:
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` that starts from an n8n base image and installs Python, your required libraries (from a `requirements.txt`), and copies your scripts into the image.
    *   Update `docker-compose.yml` to build and use this custom image.
5.  **Implement the Sell Signal Monitoring Workflow**:
    *   Translate `sell_signal_monitoring_conceptual.md` into an actual n8n workflow.
6.  **Backtesting**: Thoroughly backtest your trading strategy before deploying with real money.
