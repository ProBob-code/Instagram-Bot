# Broker API Wrapper - Conceptual Design

This document outlines the conceptual structure for Python functions to interact with a stock broker's API (e.g., Zerodha Kite, Upstox). These functions would typically be called from an n8n "Execute Command" node or be part of a more comprehensive Python service.

## Core Objectives
- Authenticate with the broker.
- Place different types of orders (buy, sell, market, limit).
- Get order status and history.
- Get current holdings.
- Handle API errors and responses gracefully.

## Security
- API keys, secrets, and access tokens must be managed securely (e.g., via environment variables, n8n credentials, or a vault). **Never hardcode credentials.**
- Broker APIs often use multi-factor authentication (MFA/TOTP) which needs to be handled, potentially involving manual steps or libraries that can manage TOTP if the broker supports API-based TOTP registration.

## Proposed Python Functions (Conceptual)

This would typically be a class, e.g., `BrokerAPIClient`.

```python
# Example structure (conceptual, not runnable code)

class BrokerAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret, access_token=None, user_id=None):
        """
        Initialize the client.
        access_token might be pre-generated or obtained via a login method.
        """
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_secret = api_secret
        self.access_token = access_token # May need to be refreshed or generated
        self.user_id = user_id # Some APIs require this
        self.base_url = "https_broker_api_endpoint_com" # Placeholder

    def _request(self, method, endpoint, params=None, data=None):
        """
        A private helper method to make HTTP requests to the broker API.
        Handles authentication headers, error checking, etc.
        """
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.access_token}", # Or API Key based
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        # response = requests.request(method, f"{self.base_url}/{endpoint}", headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
        # response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        # return response.json()
        pass # Placeholder

    def login(self, totp_token=None):
        """
        Handles the login process if separate from initialization.
        May involve redirecting to a login page or using API calls with TOTP.
        This is often the most complex part for retail broker APIs.
        For Zerodha, this involves generating a request_token, then an access_token.
        Upstox has a similar flow.
        """
        # Placeholder: Logic to obtain access_token
        # self.access_token = "newly_obtained_access_token"
        # print("Login successful, access token obtained.")
        # return self.access_token
        pass # Placeholder for actual login flow

    def place_order(self, symbol, quantity, order_type, transaction_type, product_type="D", price=None, trigger_price=None):
        """
        Places an order.
        - symbol (str): e.g., "NSE:INFY"
        - quantity (int): Number of shares.
        - order_type (str): "MARKET", "LIMIT", "SL", "SL-M"
        - transaction_type (str): "BUY" or "SELL"
        - product_type (str): "D" (Delivery/CNC), "I" (Intraday/MIS) - varies by broker
        - price (float, optional): Required for LIMIT and SL orders.
        - trigger_price (float, optional): Required for SL and SL-M orders.
        """
        order_data = {
            "tradingsymbol": symbol,
            "quantity": quantity,
            "order_type": order_type,
            "transaction_type": transaction_type,
            "product": product_type,
            # ... other parameters like price, trigger_price, exchange
        }
        # return self._request("POST", "orders", data=order_data)
        print(f"Placing {transaction_type} {order_type} order for {quantity} of {symbol}")
        return {"order_id": "dummy_order_123", "status": "PENDING", "details": order_data} # Placeholder

    def get_order_status(self, order_id):
        """
        Retrieves the status of a specific order.
        """
        # return self._request("GET", f"orders/{order_id}")
        print(f"Getting status for order: {order_id}")
        return {"order_id": order_id, "status": "COMPLETED", "filled_quantity": 5} # Placeholder

    def get_holdings(self):
        """
        Retrieves the current list of holdings.
        """
        # return self._request("GET", "portfolio/holdings")
        print("Getting current holdings")
        return [{"symbol": "NSE:INFY", "quantity": 10, "average_price": 1500.00}] # Placeholder

    # Other potential methods:
    # - cancel_order(order_id)
    # - modify_order(order_id, ...)
    # - get_funds()
    # - get_profile()
    # - refresh_access_token() (if applicable)

```

## n8n Integration
- The Python script containing this class/functions would be stored in the `utils/` or a dedicated `broker/` directory.
- An n8n "Execute Command" node would call specific functions from this script.
- Input to the script (like order details) would come from previous n8n nodes, passed as JSON via stdin.
- Output from the script (like order ID or status) would be JSON printed to stdout.
- Credentials (`API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN` if long-lived, or `TOTP_SECRET`) would be passed to the script as environment variables from n8n's credential manager or environment settings.

## Example (Zerodha - very simplified conceptual flow for n8n Execute Command)

**Command in n8n node:** `python utils/broker_actions.py place_buy_order`

**`broker_actions.py` (Illustrative):**
```python
# import sys
# import json
# from broker_api_conceptual import BrokerAPIClient # Assuming the class is in this file or another

# def main():
#     action = sys.argv[1]
#     input_data = json.loads(sys.stdin.read()) # Read data from n8n

#     # Retrieve credentials from environment variables (set in n8n Execute Command node)
#     # api_key = os.environ.get("ZERODHA_API_KEY")
#     # access_token = os.environ.get("ZERODHA_ACCESS_TOKEN") # This would need to be managed

#     # client = BrokerAPIClient(api_key=api_key, access_token=access_token) # Simplified

#     if action == "place_buy_order":
#         # result = client.place_order(
#         #     symbol=input_data["symbol"],
#         #     quantity=input_data["quantity"],
#         #     order_type="MARKET",
#         #     transaction_type="BUY"
#         # )
#         # print(json.dumps(result)) # Output to n8n

#         # Placeholder for direct call without full class structure for this example
        print(json.dumps({
            "message": "Order placed (simulated)",
            "details": input_data,
            "order_id": "sim_order_789"
        }))

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#    # main() # This part would be more fleshed out
    pass
```

This conceptual outline should guide the development of actual broker interaction scripts. The specifics will vary greatly depending on the chosen broker's API documentation.
